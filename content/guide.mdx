This guide walks you through everything you need to know to build your site with mdx-minimal.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/brijr/mdx-minimal.git my-site
cd my-site

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev
```

Your site will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Creating Content

Add `.mdx` files to the `content/` directory. Each file becomes a page at its filename route:

- `content/about.mdx` → `/about`
- `content/guide.mdx` → `/guide`
- `content/my-post.mdx` → `/my-post`

### Frontmatter

Every MDX file needs frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
description: "A brief description"
date: "2025-01-01"
author: "Your Name"
published: true
---
```

Set `published: false` to hide a post from the listing while still being accessible by URL.

## Using Components

You can use React components directly in your MDX:

```mdx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

# My Post

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

## Styling

The template uses Tailwind CSS. Prose styling is applied automatically to your content via `@tailwindcss/typography`.

### Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is handled by Shiki. Just use fenced code blocks:

~~~mdx
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```
~~~

## Customization

### Site Config

Edit `lib/config.ts` to update site metadata:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Site",
  description: "Your description",
  // ...
}
```

### Theme

Modify `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to customize colors and styling.

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel with one click or use any platform that supports Next.js:

```bash
bun run build
```

The output will be in the `.next` directory, ready for deployment.

## Tips

- Keep posts short and focused
- Use headings to structure content
- Add images to `public/` and reference them with `/image.png`
- The template is designed for simplicity—resist the urge to over-engineer
